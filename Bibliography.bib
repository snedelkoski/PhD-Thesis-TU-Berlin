abstract="Logs are extensively used during the development and maintenance of software systems. They collect runtime events and allow tracking of code execution, which enables a variety of critical tasks such as troubleshooting and fault detection. However, large-scale software systems generate massive volumes of semi-structured log records, posing a major challenge for automated analysis. Parsing semi-structured records with free-form text log messages into structured templates is the first and crucial step that enables further analysis. Existing approaches rely on log-specific heuristics or manual rule extraction. These are often specialized in parsing certain log types, and thus, limit performance scores and generalization. We propose a novel parsing technique called NuLog that utilizes a self-supervised learning model and formulates the parsing task as masked language modeling (MLM). In the process of parsing, the model extracts summarizations from the logs in the form of a vector embedding. This allows the coupling of the MLM as pre-training with a downstream anomaly detection task. We evaluate the parsing performance of NuLog on 10 real-world log datasets and compare the results with 12 parsing techniques. The results show that NuLog outperforms existing methods in parsing accuracy with an average of 99{\%} and achieves the lowest edit distance to the ground truth templates. Additionally, two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the ability of the approach for log-based anomaly detection in both supervised and unsupervised scenario. The results show that NuLog can be successfully used to support troubleshooting tasks. The implementation is available at https://github.com/nulog/nulog."

pages="137--149",
abstract="Data often are formed of multiple modalities, which jointly describe the observed phenomena. Modeling the joint distribution of multimodal data requires larger expressive power to capture high-level concepts and provide better data representations. However, multimodal generative models based on variational inference are limited due to the lack of flexibility of the approximate posterior, which is obtained by searching within a known parametric family of distributions. We introduce a method that improves the representational capacity of multimodal variational methods using normalizing flows. It approximates the joint posterior with a simple parametric distribution and subsequently transforms into a more complex one. Through several experiments, we demonstrate that the model improves on state-of-the-art multimodal methods based on variational inference on various computer vision tasks such as colorization, edge and mask detection, and weakly supervised learning. We also show that learning more powerful approximate joint distributions improves the quality of the generated samples. The code of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/SashoNedelkoski/BPFDMVM."

abstract="The emerging field of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) utilizes monitoring data, big data platforms, and machine learning, to automate operations and maintenance (O{\&}M) tasks in complex IT systems. The available research data usually contain only a single source of information, often logs or metrics. The inability of the single-source data to describe precise state of the distributed systems leads to methods that fail to make effective use of the joint information, thus, producing large number of false predictions. Therefore, current data limits the possibilities for greater advances in AIOps research. To overcome these constraints, we created a complex distributed system testbed, which generates multi-source data composed of distributed traces, application logs, and metrics. This paper provides detailed descriptions of the infrastructure, testbed, experiments, and statistics of the generated data. Furthermore, it identifies how such data can be utilized as a stepping stone for the development of novel methods for O{\&}M tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and remediation."

Today’s systems provide voluminous traces from each component but do not synthesise the data into concise models of system performance. We argue that online performance modelling should be a ubiquitous operating system service and outline several uses including performance debugging, capacity planning, system tuning and anomaly detection. We describe the Magpie modelling service which collates detailed traces from multiple machines in an e-commerce site, extracts request-specific audit trails, and constructs probabilistic models of request behaviour. A feasibility study evaluates the approach using an offline demonstrator. Results show that the approach is promising, but that there are many challenges to building a truly ubiquitious, online modelling infrastructure.},

title = {Mining Invariants from Console Logs for System Problem Detection},
booktitle = {Annual Technical Conference},
year = {2010},
abstract = {
Detecting execution anomalies is very important to the maintenance and monitoring of large-scale distributed systems. People often use console logs that are produced by distributed systems for troubleshooting and problem diagnosis. However, manually inspecting con-sole logs for the detection of anomalies is unfeasible due to the increasing scale and complexity of distributed systems. Therefore, there is a great demand for automatic anomaly detection techniques based on log analysis. In this paper, we propose an unstructured log analysis technique for anomaly detection. In the technique, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically discover program invariants in logs. At first, we covert the unstructured logs to structured logs through a log parsing step. Then, we group the log messages according to the relationship among log parameters. After that, we learn the program invariants from the log message groups. The mined invariants can reveal the inherent linear characteristics of program work flows. With these learned invariants, we can automatically detect anomalies in logs. Experiments on Hadoop show that the technique can effectively detect execution anomalies. Compared with the state of art approaches, our approach can not only detect numerous real problems with high accuracy but also provide intuitive insight to the problems.

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression."

title = "Detecting anomalies in time series data via a deep learning algorithm combining wavelets, neural networks and Hilbert transform",
abstract = "The quest for more efficient real-time detection of anomalies in time series data is critically important in numerous applications and systems ranging from intelligent transportation, structural health monitoring, heart disease, and earthquake prediction. Although the range of application is wide, anomaly detection algorithms are usually domain specific and build on experts’ knowledge. Here a new signal processing algorithm –inspired by the deep learning paradigm – is presented that combines wavelets, neural networks, and Hilbert transform performs robustly and is transferable. The proposed neural network structure facilitates learning short and long-term pattern interdependencies; a task usually hard to accomplish using standard neural network training algorithms. The paper provides guidelines for selecting the neural network's buffer size, training algorithm, and anomaly detection features. The algorithm learns online the system’s normal behavior and does not require the existence of anomalous data, for assessing its statistical significance. This is essential for applications that require customization. The anomalies are detected by analyzing hierarchically the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the residual signal. Its applicability is demonstrated through detection of anomalies in the Seismic Electric Signal activity, that is potentially important for earthquake prediction; and automated detection of road anomalies (e.g. potholes, bumps, etc.) using smartphone sensors. The evaluation of the anomaly detection algorithm is based on the statistical significance of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Finally, we propose strategies for decision-making that may increase the efficiency of the application of the algorithm, and expedite evaluation of real-time data.",

In this paper we introduce a new anomaly detection method{---}Context Vector Data Description (CVDD){---}which builds upon word embedding models to learn multiple sentence representations that capture multiple semantic contexts via the self-attention mechanism. Modeling multiple contexts enables us to perform contextual anomaly detection of sentences and phrases with respect to the multiple themes and concepts present in an unlabeled text corpus. These contexts in combination with the self-attention weights make our method highly interpretable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CVDD quantitatively as well as qualitatively on the well-known Reuters, 20 Newsgroups, and IMDB Movie Reviews datasets.",

abstract="Log files are created by devices or systems in order to provide information about processes or actions that were performed. Detailed inspection of security logs can reveal potential security breaches and it can show us system weaknesses. In our work we propose a novel anomaly-based detection approach based on data mining techniques for log analysis. Our approach uses Apache Hadoop technique to enable processing of large data sets in a parallel way. Dynamic rule creation enables us to detect new types of breaches without further human intervention. Overall error rates of our method are below 10{\%}."

title = "Detecting anomalies in time series data via a deep learning algorithm combining wavelets, neural networks and Hilbert transform",
abstract = "The quest for more efficient real-time detection of anomalies in time series data is critically important in numerous applications and systems ranging from intelligent transportation, structural health monitoring, heart disease, and earthquake prediction. Although the range of application is wide, anomaly detection algorithms are usually domain specific and build on experts’ knowledge. Here a new signal processing algorithm –inspired by the deep learning paradigm – is presented that combines wavelets, neural networks, and Hilbert transform performs robustly and is transferable. The proposed neural network structure facilitates learning short and long-term pattern interdependencies; a task usually hard to accomplish using standard neural network training algorithms. The paper provides guidelines for selecting the neural network's buffer size, training algorithm, and anomaly detection features. The algorithm learns online the system’s normal behavior and does not require the existence of anomalous data, for assessing its statistical significance. This is essential for applications that require customization. The anomalies are detected by analyzing hierarchically the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the residual signal. Its applicability is demonstrated through detection of anomalies in the Seismic Electric Signal activity, that is potentially important for earthquake prediction; and automated detection of road anomalies (e.g. potholes, bumps, etc.) using smartphone sensors. The evaluation of the anomaly detection algorithm is based on the statistical significance of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Finally, we propose strategies for decision-making that may increase the efficiency of the application of the algorithm, and expedite evaluation of real-time data.",

title = "Detecting anomalies in time series data via a deep learning algorithm combining wavelets, neural networks and Hilbert transform",
abstract = "The quest for more efficient real-time detection of anomalies in time series data is critically important in numerous applications and systems ranging from intelligent transportation, structural health monitoring, heart disease, and earthquake prediction. Although the range of application is wide, anomaly detection algorithms are usually domain specific and build on experts’ knowledge. Here a new signal processing algorithm –inspired by the deep learning paradigm – is presented that combines wavelets, neural networks, and Hilbert transform performs robustly and is transferable. The proposed neural network structure facilitates learning short and long-term pattern interdependencies; a task usually hard to accomplish using standard neural network training algorithms. The paper provides guidelines for selecting the neural network's buffer size, training algorithm, and anomaly detection features. The algorithm learns online the system’s normal behavior and does not require the existence of anomalous data, for assessing its statistical significance. This is essential for applications that require customization. The anomalies are detected by analyzing hierarchically the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the residual signal. Its applicability is demonstrated through detection of anomalies in the Seismic Electric Signal activity, that is potentially important for earthquake prediction; and automated detection of road anomalies (e.g. potholes, bumps, etc.) using smartphone sensors. The evaluation of the anomaly detection algorithm is based on the statistical significance of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Finally, we propose strategies for decision-making that may increase the efficiency of the application of the algorithm, and expedite evaluation of real-time data.",

The k-means problem asks for a set C of k centers minimizing the sum of the squared distances from every point in a set P to its nearest center in C. In a data stream, the points arrive one by one in arbitrary order and there is limited storage space.",

When end-users encounter software defects, they report the bug to developers by specifying the expected behavior and error messages (e.g., log message). Then, they wait for a bug fix from the developers. However, on the developers' side, it can be very challenging and expensive to debug the problem. To fix the bugs, developers often have to play the role of detectives: seeking clues in the user-reported logs files or stack trace in a snapshot of specific system execution. This debugging process may take several hours or even days.In this paper, we first look at the usefulness of the user-reported logs. Then, we propose an automated approach to assist the debugging process by reconstructing the execution path. Through the analysis, our investigation shows that 31% of the time, developer further requests logs from the reporter. Moreover, our preliminary results show that the reconducted path illustrates the user's execution. We believe that our approach proposes a novel solution in debugging production failures.},

title = {Statistical Log Differencing},
year = {2019},
publisher = {IEEE},
abstract = {Recent works have considered the problem of log differencing: given two or more system's execution logs, output a model of their differences. Log differencing has potential applications in software evolution, testing, and security.In this paper we present statistical log differencing, which accounts for frequencies of behaviors found in the logs. We present two algorithms, s2KDiff for differencing two logs, and snKDiff, for differencing of many logs at once, both presenting their results over a single inferred model. A unique aspect of our algorithms is their use of statistical hypothesis testing: we let the engineer control the sensitivity of the analysis by setting the target distance between probabilities and the statistical significance value, and report only (and all) the statistically significant differences.Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of our work in terms of soundness, completeness, and performance. It also demonstrates its effectiveness compared to previous work via a user-study and its potential applications via a case study using real-world logs.},

abstract = {Computer applications, such as servers, databases and middleware, ubiquitously emit execution traces stored in log files. The use of logs for the analysis of application failures is known since the early days of computers. Field data studies have shown that application logs are fraught with uncertainty, i.e., missing or noisy events in the logs. A body of research that has dealt successfully with uncertainty in event logs is process mining from the business process management community, specifically by discovering process models. The literature has shown the value of process mining across several domains, but as yet there is no study that quantifies possible improvements from using process models, and the impact of uncertainty in the context of application failures. This work addresses the use of process mining for detecting failures from application logs. First, process models are discovered from logs; then conformance checking is used to detect deviations from the models. We contribute to knowledge engineering research with a systematic measurement study that quantifies the failure detection capability of conformance checking in spite of missing events, and its accuracy with respect to process models obtained from noisy logs. Analysis is done with a dataset of 55,462 execution traces from three independent real-life applications. We obtain a mixed answer depending on the application under test; our measurements provide insights into the use of process mining for failure analysis.}
